# Vanishing Squares

# Introduction

This is screensaver / browser bauble of rectangles appearing then receeding to vanishing point.

It is written in HTML 5. There are two versions: one black and white and one color.

To preview what these look like without cloning the repo. (GitHub will show only the HTML code, not the broswer rendering.)
