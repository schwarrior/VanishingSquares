# Vanishing Squares

# Introduction

This is screensaver / browser bauble of rectangles appearing then receeding to vanishing point.

It is written in HTML 5. There are two versions: one black and white and one color.

To preview what these look like without cloning the repo, use the links below. (Otherwise GitHub will show only the HTML code, not the broswer rendering.)
